It actually describes clowns planning to use school shootings as a way to disarm the citizenry. \n\nThis looks legit to me, astonishing as the quotes are. What say you all? \n\nBehold a Pale Horse — Milton William (Bill) Cooper, 1991\nhttp://  a.co/0IZY9ra\n\n“Bill Cooper, former United States Naval Intelligence Briefing Team member, reveals information that remains hidden from the public eye. This information has been kept in topsecret government files since the 1940s. His audiences hear the truth unfold as he writes about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the war on drugs, the secret government, and UFOs. Bill is a lucid, rational, and powerful speaker whose intent is to inform and to empower his audience. Standing room only is normal. His presentation and information transcend partisan affiliations as he clearly addresses issues in a way that has a striking impact on listeners of all backgrounds and interests. He has spoken to many groups throughout the United States and has appeared regularly on many radio talk shows and on television. In 1988 Bill decided to \"talk\" due to events then taking place worldwide, events that he had seen plans for back in the early 1970s. Bill correctly predicted the lowering of the Iron Curtain, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the invasion of Panama. All Bill's predictions were on record well before the events occurred. Bill is not a psychic. His information comes from top secret documents that he read while with the Intelligence Briefing Team and from over seventeen years of research.”\n",

We believe these actions were a coordinated attack against the democracy of our country.\n\nThe DHS will be submitting a final report to the WH/DOJ/other state and local agencies outlining our findings as early as March [  ], 2018. While this report only encompasses a sampling of twenty-two (22) counties across the U.S., it is strongly suggested, based on the evidence provided, that a mandated countrywide investigation begin under the recommended US50-EIC guidelines as set forth in Section VII of the final report.

Digital signals allow for much greater distance to be covered on much less power (thus miniaturization of phones) because of the nature of square (digital) waves.  Much more effective at filtering noise and interference.  \n\nThis inherently means that the phones of today are going to be square wave signals and very low power.  If that alone were enough, Q would not exist.  They would simply shut him (them) and/or us down.  So they may act as a trigger but are not enough by themselves to completely program a human.  And Parkland would suggest that you really need somebody who is largely predisposed toward moving in the desired direction to begin with.  You can't just flip a switch and a born pacifist suddenly becomes Rambo.  Talk to me, Johnny!\n",

Digital signals allow for much greater distance to be covered on much less power (thus miniaturization of phones) because of the nature of square (digital) waves.  Much more effective at filtering noise and interference.  \n\nThis inherently means that the phones of today are going to be square wave signals and very low power.  If that alone were enough, Q would not exist.  They would simply shut him (them) and/or us down.  So they may act as a trigger but are not enough by themselves to completely program a human.  And Parkland would suggest that you really need somebody who is largely predisposed toward moving in the desired direction to begin with.  You can't just flip a switch and a born pacifist suddenly becomes Rambo.  Talk to me, Johnny!\n",

As someone who spent the past 27 years working with him at EFF, I can say that nothing could be further from the truth. Barlow knew that new technology could create and empower evil as much as it could create and empower good. He made a conscious decision to focus on the latter: \"I knew it’s also true that a good way to invent the future is to predict it. So I predicted Utopia, hoping to give Liberty a running start before the laws of Moore and Metcalfe delivered up what Ed Snowden now correctly calls 'turn-key totalitarianism.'”\n\nBarlow’s lasting legacy is that he devoted his life to making the Internet into “a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth . . . a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.”\n\nIn the days and weeks to come, we will be talking and writing more about what a extraordinary role Barlow played for the Internet and the world. And as always, we will continue the work to fulfill his dream.\n\nSource: https:// www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/john-perry-barlow-internet-pioneer-1947-2018\n",

Train drags truck body down the tracks until the body rolls off down the embankment.\n\nQuestion is, if truck tried to run crossing, why didn't occupants flee cab when getting stuck, unless train hit the truck just as it was trying to run the crossing.?\n\nHave to figure, though, if aerial surveillance sees truck and warns engineer, the truck had to have been there for a while, so why didn't occupants flee?\n\nIf the truck was there as a plant, the only sense I can make of it is that the occupants were patsies, i.e., they were told they were only going to force the train to stop, on the idea of an antifa protest.\n\nI don't think surveillance would see a truck headed towards the crossing and tell the engineer to brake, assuming the truck would stop on the tracks. However, it could be that the access road was closed and any traffic was regarded as a danger.\n\nKey is how fast does an amtrak train usually go through there, and how fast was this one going. If this train was slower, then why?\n",

Fleiss soon took over Madame Alex's business. \n\nFleiss brought her young friends to work for her, and the business grew from $50,000 a month to grossing $300,000 per month.\n\nPlayed matchmaker to the richest men in the world, carefully pairing them with women tailored to their fantasies, making all the financial and travel arrangements, and keeping 40 percent of the fee for herself.\n\nAttended the same high school as Bo Barrett, Leonardo DiCaprio, Anne-Marie Johnson, and Julie Newmar.\n\nProhibited from entering Canada due to her indictable offence, according to Canadian criminal law.\n",

Not Trump- Russia collusion.\n\nHANNITY: I've been predicting this, Dr. Gorka this massive boomerang for a long time. I've known a lot of this evidence was out there and it was all coming. I've been telling my audience, its coming, and its coming. Now the floodgates are open, if you will.\n\nSEBASTIAN GORKA, DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: It's the last scene from that great Tom Clancy movie, \"The hunt for red October.\" When the bad submarine commander launch a torpedo it comes back and sinks his own vessel. That is what the Russian collusion story has done for the DNC and for Hillary. Let's stop using the word collusion, because the evidence we now have is about subversion, it's about sabotaging the political process and it's about propaganda. In the cold war, the Soviet Union will be used what was called active measures to undermine our democracy. This is the Democrat Party, the Hillary campaign using active measures to undermine Donald Trump and the Democratic process in America. It's a shocking story.\n",

On POTUS’ order, we have initiated certain fail-safes that shall safeguard the public from the primary fallout which is slated to occur 11.3 upon the arrest announcement of Mr. Podesta (actionable 11.4). Confirmation (to the public) of what is occurring will then be revealed and will not be openly accepted. Public riots are being organized in serious numbers in an effort to prevent the arrest and capture of more senior public officials. On POTUS’ order, a state of temporary military control will be actioned and special ops carried out. False leaks have been made to retain several within the confines of the United States to prevent extradition and special operator necessity. Rest assured, the safety and well-being of every man, woman, and child of this country is being exhausted in full. However, the atmosphere within the country will unfortunately be divided as so many have fallen for the corrupt and evil narrative that has long been broadcast. We will be initiating the Emergency Broadcast System (EMS) during this time in an effort to provide a direct message (avoiding the fake news) to all citizens. Organizations and/or people that wish to do us harm during this time will be met with swift fury – certain laws have been pre-lifted to provide our great military the necessary authority to handle and conduct these operations (at home and abroad).",

POTUS knows he must clean house (gov't) in order to 'free up' and demonstrate who has authority in order to pass important legislation. This was always the priority. Remember, AG Sessions cannot look like an impartial player that is out to get all former Obama team members as we need him for other important work. All will come into focus and for anyone to think POTUS is not in control is kidding themselves. Also, he's 100% insulated with zero risk of impeachment (fact).",
